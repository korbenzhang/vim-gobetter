# vim-gobetter

vim-gobetter make vim go better.

YouCompleteMe provide completion, synax check and others, seems work good for me. But I used to use vim-go such as GoBuild and etc. So I copy some code from vim-go, not include LSP support, make a minimal go code support in Vim, make Vim work more quickly.

Enjoy it.
